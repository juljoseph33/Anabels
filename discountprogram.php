<div id="aboutdp">
	<p>In order to make healthy food affordable for all students, we have decided to implement a <span class="color">subsidized discount system</span>. Undergraduate students will be able to <span class="color">apply</span> for a free discount online by filling out a short survey (available soon!) assessing their ability to afford meals, then the Directors of the store will issue subsidies <span class="color">based on need and available funds</span>. Our goal is to make the process as <span class="color">user-friendly</span> and <span class="color">anonymous</span> as possible to make it easy for students with need to apply and use discounts at our store.</p>

		<h3>The Logistics</h3>
		<p>When students check out at the store, they will present their student ID cards. All students receiving discounts will be inputted into our POS system so that when their card is swiped, their discount is applied. <br><br>Only the student working the cash register and the student paying for goods will be able to see the discount applied. The students working the cash register take confidentiality oaths and undergo comprehensive sensitivity training so that they can best respect students receiving the discounted price of goods.</p>
