		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>According to the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, <span class="color">food insecurity</span> is defined as an, "economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food." The direct consequence of food insecurity is <span class="color">hunger</span>, "an individual-level physiological condition that may result from food insecurity," and which refers to, "a potential consequence of food insecurity that, because of prolonged, involuntary lack of food, results in <span class="color">discomfort, illness, weakness, or pain</span> that goes beyond the usual uneasy sensation." <br><br>Large problems require large-scale innovation in response--and the problem faced in universities across America regarding food insecurity is too real to thousands of <span class="color">financially disadvantaged students</span>.</p>
		<h2 class="fadeInBlock">At Cornell</h2>
		<p class="fadeInBlock">Many students often supplement meals with <span class="color">calorie-dense</span> foods in Collegetown convenience stores such as Jason's or 7/11. Students also often cook <span class="color">unbalanced meals</span> lacking essential fruits and vegetables because of a lack of access to or knowledge about preparing and cooking these foods. Research indicates that most college students do not consume the <span class="color">recommended minimum of five servings of fruits and vegetables</span> per day. Additionally, college students are shown to be <span class="color">less aware</span> of the health benefits of fruits and vegetables and the harmful effects of poor dietary practices than older adults. <br><br>This grocery store will give students <span class="color">access to affordable produce</span> while providing them with important recipe and cooking instruction that will help them <span class="color">maintain a healthy lifestyle</span> throughout their college years and beyond.</p>
		<h2 class="fadeInBlock">Our Solution</h2>
		<p class="fadeInBlock">Utilizing a strong <span class="color">partnership with the community</span> and the local economy through the Center for Transformative Action, Anabel's Grocery seeks to break down social stigmas attached to food aid. To do so, we have implemented a <span class="color">tiered, subsidized payment program</span> to ensure access to healthy, affordable basic food needs for the entire student body. Additionally, we offer <span class="color">cooking classes, meal planning, and pot and pan rentals</span>, to be proactive in promoting healthier lifestyles. <br><br>The mind and body of every Cornell student matters. We aim to provide the <span class="color">resources</span> to teach students about nutritious eating, how to buy in bulk, and how to use the ingredients in our store to cook on their own. We offer the chance to <span class="color">empower</span> students to make their own meals instead of simply providing prepared goods or unhealthy snacks.</p>
