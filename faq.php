	<h3>How will the grocery store be staffed? Do you believe the executive board is committed enough/have enough time? What happens after you leave?</h3>
	<div><p>As thoroughly described in the business plan, there are 18 executive board members who were carefully chosen according to their passion for the project and their corresponding skill. Each member, by committing to the e-board, also knowingly committed to at least 5-10 hours a week of volunteer work. In addition to these directors, volunteer leadership teams will be formed around each position to ensure maximum effectiveness. The grocery store will be staffed with these e-board members as well as volunteer staff, incentivized with food discounts. We will also hire cashiers to operate our one checkout in two-hour shifts. The cashier position will be a minimum wage position. As our net income becomes more predictable over the course of our launch year, we will consider adding more paid positions in addition to expanding our volunteer program.</p></div>
	<h3>Is food insecurity even a problem at Cornell? Don't students receive financial aid that supports them? Are students just not eating what they are provided, lots of resources across campus?</h3>
	<div><p>As seen in the recent Cornell PULSE survey, 22% of Cornell students "skipped  meals or [did not have] enough to eat because of financial constraints" (3% very often, 5% often, 14% occasionally). But the problem goes beyond simple statistics. If we are serious about the idea that Cornell students' bodies and minds matter, then it is essential that we take action to create more healthy, affordable food access. Student financial aid does not necessarily cover all expenses, not all food insecure students have financial aid, and relying on food from free events around campus is an unsustainable, unreliable, and stressful way to plan daily meals.</p></div>
	<h3>Are there other models (i.e. food pantries) that would work better?</h3>
	<div><p>The most current research on food insecurity indicates that food pantry models are unsustainable. Moreover, they perpetuate social stigma, especially on a highly privileged campus like Cornell. Increasing financial aid, dining dollars, etc. are not viable options since they do not fundamentally address issues of food access and insecurity, and are not supported by Cornell administration. The efforts of 626 Thurston Ave, which currently provides only dried goods and snacks inadvertently help exacerbate an invisible class divide, separating students who can afford Cornell Dining and Collegetown options from students who are willing to overcome stigma and accept "handouts". Food pantries are only options at large, public universities where stigma associated with affordability does not exist because the socioeconomic spectrum is less stark.</p></div>
	<h3>Won't the subsidy discounts reduce revenue and keep the store from being viable?</h3>
	<div><p>The subsidies will be funded from a donation fund that is entirely separate from store operations. This money will reimburse any revenue lost due to customers using discounts so that the store does not experience any loss.</p></div>
